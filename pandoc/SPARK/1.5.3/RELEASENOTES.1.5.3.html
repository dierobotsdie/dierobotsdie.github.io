<h1 id="apache-spark-1.5.3-release-notes">Apache Spark 1.5.3 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12016">SPARK-12016</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>word2vec load model can't use findSynonyms to get words</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I use word2vec.fit to train a word2vecModel and then save the model to file system. when I load the model from file system, I found I can use transform('a') to get a vector, but I can't use findSynonyms('a', 2) to get some words.</p>
<p>I use the fellow code to test word2vec</p>
<p>from pyspark import SparkContext from pyspark.mllib.feature import Word2Vec, Word2VecModel</p>
<p>import os, tempfile from shutil import rmtree</p>
<p>if __name__ == '__main__': sc = SparkContext('local', 'test') sentence = &quot;a b &quot; * 100 + &quot;a c &quot; * 10 localDoc = [sentence, sentence] doc = sc.parallelize(localDoc).map(lambda line: line.split(&quot; &quot;)) model = Word2Vec().setVectorSize(10).setSeed(42).fit(doc)</p>
<pre><code>syms = model\.findSynonyms\(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, 2\)
print \[s\[0\] for s in syms\]
path = tempfile\.mkdtemp\(\)
model\.save\(sc, path\)
sameModel = Word2VecModel\.load\(sc, path\)
print model\.transform\(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;\) == sameModel\.transform\(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;\)
syms = sameModel\.findSynonyms\(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, 2\)
print \[s\[0\] for s in syms\]
try:
    rmtree\(path\)
except OSError:
    pass</code></pre>
<p>I got &quot;[u'b', u'c']&quot; when the first printf then the “True” and &quot; [u'__class__'] &quot; I don't know how to get 'b' or 'c' with sameModel.findSynonyms(&quot;a&quot;, 2)</p>
