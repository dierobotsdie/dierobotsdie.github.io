<h1 id="apache-spark-1.5.0-release-notes">Apache Spark 1.5.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10578">SPARK-10578</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifer does not return `rawPrediction` column</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To use `pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifer` with `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`, a column called `rawPrediction` needs to be returned by the `RandomForestClassifer`. The PySpark documentation example of `logisticsRegression`outputs the `rawPrediction` column but not `RandomForestClassifier`.</p>
<p>Therefore, one is unable to use `RandomForestClassifier` with the evaluator nor put it in a pipeline with cross validation.</p>
<p>A relevant piece of code showing how to reproduce the bug can be found at: https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/cf61ae655b032f754bfb</p>
<p>A relevant post due to this possible bug can also be found at: http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Issue-with-running-CrossValidator-with-RandomForestClassifier-on-dataset-td23791.html</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6936">SPARK-6936</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>SQLContext.sql() caused deadlock in multi-thread env</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Doing (the same query) in more than one threads with SQLConext.sql may lead to deadlock. Here is a way to reproduce it (since this is multi-thread issue, the reproduction may or may not be so easy).</p>
<p>1. Register a relatively big table.</p>
<p>2. Create two different classes and in the classes, do the same query in a method and put the results in a set and print out the set size.</p>
<p>3. Create two threads to use an object from each class in the run method. Start the threads. For my tests, it can have a deadlock just in a few runs.</p>
