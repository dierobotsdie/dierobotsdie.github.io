<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-1772">MAHOUT-1772</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>delimiterPattern instance variable of FileDataModel should be marked as a Transient field</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I am trying to implement a recommender using Mahout. To create the DataModel I am using FileDataModel type. After creating the Recommender object , I want to save the model for later usage , just like what we have in Spark models. FileDataModel is implementing and inheriting Serializable classes , so this means that it can be Serialized. However when I try to write it the &quot;java.io.NotSerializableException: com.google.common.base.Splitter&quot; exception is thrown. The root cause of this exception is &quot;private final Splitter delimiterPattern;&quot; variable of FileDataModel class. It is a non-serializable third party class which is not marked as a transient field in the FileDataModel class, as a result of this we get the exception mentioned above. As a workaround , I created my own &quot;MyFileDataModel&quot; which is an exact copy of &quot;FileDataModel&quot; class but the &quot;delimiterPattern&quot; variable is marked as transient and it works perfectly. It would be better to mark the field as transient in the original class.</p>
