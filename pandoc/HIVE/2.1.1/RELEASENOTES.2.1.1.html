<p>&quot;-d&quot; option has been added to Hive CLI &quot;reset&quot; command, allowing one to reset specific settings to built-in defaults, overriding any session-specific values, as well as configuration files in use. E.g. &quot;reset -d hive.compute.splits.in.am hive.smbjoin.cache.rows&quot;.</p>
