</ul>
<p>Options to sort output of fs -ls comment: -t (mtime), -S (size), -u (atime), -r (reverse)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11226">HADOOP-11226</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add a configuration to set ipc.Client's traffic class with IPTOS_LOWDELAY|IPTOS_RELIABILITY</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9477">HADOOP-9477</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add posixGroups support for LDAP groups mapping service</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Add posixGroups support for LDAP groups mapping service. The change in LDAPGroupMapping is compatible with previous scenario. In LDAP, the group mapping between {{posixAccount}} and {{posixGroup}} is different from the general LDAPGroupMapping, one of the differences is the {{&quot;memberUid&quot;}} will be used to mapping {{posixAccount}} and {{posixGroup}}. The feature will handle the mapping in internal when configuration {{hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.user}} is set as &quot;posixAccount&quot; and {{hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.group}} is &quot;posixGroup&quot;.</p>

</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<ul>
<li><p>The release notes now only contains JIRA issues with incompatible changes and actual release notes. The generated format has been changed from HTML to markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>The changelog is now automatically generated from data stored in JIRA rather than manually maintained. The format has been changed from pure text to markdown as well as containing more of the information that was previously stored in the release notes.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to generate the changes file, python must be installed.</p></li>
<li><p>New -Preleasedocs profile added to maven in order to trigger this functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3365">YARN-3365</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add support for using the 'tc' tool via container-executor</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding support for using the 'tc' tool in batch mode via container-executor. This is a prerequisite for traffic-shaping functionality that is necessary to support outbound bandwidth as a resource in YARN.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3443">YARN-3443</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Create a 'ResourceHandler' subsystem to ease addition of support for new resource types on the NM</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The current cgroups implementation is closely tied to supporting CPU as a resource . This patch separates out CGroups implementation into a reusable class as well as provides a simple ResourceHandler subsystem that will enable us to add support for new resource types on the NM - e.g Network, Disk etc.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6666">HDFS-6666</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Abort NameNode and DataNode startup if security is enabled but block access token is not enabled.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NameNode and DataNode now abort during startup if attempting to run in secure mode, but block access tokens are not enabled by setting configuration property dfs.block.access.token.enable to true in hdfs-site.xml. Previously, this case logged a warning, because this would be an insecure configuration.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3021">YARN-3021</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>YARN's delegation-token handling disallows certain trust setups to operate properly over DistCp</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>ResourceManager renews delegation tokens for applications. This behavior has been changed to renew tokens only if the token's renewer is a non-empty string. MapReduce jobs can instruct ResourceManager to skip renewal of tokens obtained from certain hosts by specifying the hosts with configuration mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers.token-renewal.exclude=&lt;host1&gt;,&lt;host2&gt;,..,&lt;hostN&gt;.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11746">HADOOP-11746</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>rewrite test-patch.sh</strong></li>

<li>JIRA comments now use much more markup to improve readability</li>
<li>test-patch.sh now supports either a file name, a URL, or a JIRA issue as input in developer mode</li>
<li>If part of the patch testing code is changed, test-patch.sh will now attempt to re-executing itself using the new version.</li>
<li>Some logic to try and reduce the amount of unnecessary tests. For example, patches that only modify markdown should not run the Java compilation tests.</li>
<li>Plugins for checkstyle, shellcheck, and whitespace now execute as necessary.</li>
<li>New test code for mvn site</li>
<li>A breakdown of the times needed to execute certain blocks as well as a total runtime is now reported to assist in fixing long running tests and optimize the entire process.</li>
<li>Several new options</li>
<li>--resetrepo will put test-patch.sh in destructive mode, similar to a normal Jenkins run</li>
<li>--testlist allows one to provide a comma delimited list of test subsystems to forcibly execute</li>
<li>--modulelist to provide a comma delimited list of module tests to execute in addition to the ones that are automatically detected</li>
<li>--offline mode to attempt to stop connecting to the Internet for certain operations</li>
<li>test-patch.sh now defaults to the POSIX equivalents on Solaris and Illumos-based operating systems</li>
<li>shelldocs.py may be used to generate test-patch.sh API information</li>
<li>FindBugs output is now listed on the JIRA comment</li>
<li>lots of general code cleanup, including attempts to remove any local state files to reduce potential race conditions</li>
<li>Some logic to determine if a patch is for a given major branch using several strategies as well as a particular git ref (using git+ref as part of the name).</li>
<li>Some logic to determine if a patch references a particular JIRA issue.</li>
<li>Unit tests are only flagged as necessary with native or Java code, since Hadoop has no framework in place yet for other types of unit tests.</li>
<li>test-patch now exits with a failure status if problems arise trying to do git checkouts. Previously the exit code was success.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3366">YARN-3366</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Outbound network bandwidth : classify/shape traffic originating from YARN containers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>1) A TrafficController class that provides an implementation for traffic shaping using tc. 2) A ResourceHandler implementation for OutboundBandwidth as a resource - isolation/enforcement using cgroups and tc.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11861">HADOOP-11861</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>test-patch.sh rewrite addendum patch</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<ul>
<li>--build-native=false should work now</li>
<li>--branch option lets one specify a branch to test against on the command line</li>
<li>On certain Jenkins machines, the artifact directory sometimes gets deleted from outside the test-patch script. There is now some code to try to detect, alert, and quick exit if that happens.</li>
<li>Various semi-critical output and bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10597">HADOOP-10597</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>RPC Server signals backoff to clients when all request queues are full</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This change introduces a new configuration key used by RPC server to decide whether to send backoff signal to RPC Client when RPC call queue is full. When the feature is enabled, RPC server will no longer block on the processing of RPC requests when RPC call queue is full. It helps to improve quality of service when the service is under heavy load. The configuration key is in the format of &quot;ipc.#port#.backoff.enable&quot; where #port# is the port number that RPC server listens on. For example, if you want to enable the feature for the RPC server that listens on 8020, set ipc.8020.backoff.enable to true.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11843">HADOOP-11843</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make setting up the build environment easier</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Includes a docker based solution for setting up a build environment with minimal effort.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11813">HADOOP-11813</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>releasedocmaker.py should use today's date instead of unreleased</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6888">HDFS-6888</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Allow selectively audit logging ops</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Specific HDFS ops can be selectively excluded from audit logging via 'dfs.namenode.audit.log.debug.cmdlist' configuration.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8157">HDFS-8157</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Writes to RAM DISK reserve locked memory for block files</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This change requires setting the dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory configuration key to use the HDFS Lazy Persist feature. Its value limits the combined off-heap memory for blocks in RAM via caching and lazy persist writes.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11772">HADOOP-11772</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>RPC Invoker relies on static ClientCache which has synchronized(this) blocks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Client#call() methods that are deprecated since 0.23 have been removed.</p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-41">YARN-41</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>The RM should handle the graceful shutdown of the NM.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of shutdown a NM could be different (if NM work preserving is not enabled): NM will unregister to RM immediately rather than waiting for timeout to be LOST. A new status of NodeStatus - SHUTDOWN is involved which could affect UI, CLI and ClusterMetrics for node's status.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8582">HDFS-8582</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Support getting a list of reconfigurable config properties and do not generate spurious reconfig warnings</strong></li>

<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6564">HDFS-6564</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Use slf4j instead of common-logging in hdfs-client</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Users may need special attention for this change while upgrading to this version. Previously hdfs client was using commons-logging as the logging framework. With this change it will use slf4j framework. For more details about slf4j, please see: http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html. Also, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo#LOG public static member variable has been removed as it is not used anywhere. Users need to correct their code if any one has a reference to this variable. One can retrieve the named logger via the logging framework of their choice directly like, org.slf4j.Logger LOG = org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.CachePoolInfo.class);</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3823">YARN-3823</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Fix mismatch in default values for yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores property</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>There is a typo in the event string &quot;WORKFLOW_ID&quot; (as &quot;WORKLFOW_ID&quot;). The branch-2 change will publish both event strings for compatibility with consumers, but the misspelled metric will be removed in trunk.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7582">HDFS-7582</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Enforce maximum number of ACL entries separately per access and default.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Limit on Maximum number of ACL entries(32) will be enforced separately on access and default ACLs. So in total, max. 64 ACL entries can be present in a ACL spec.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12269">HADOOP-12269</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Update aws-sdk dependency to 1.10.6; move to aws-sdk-s3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Maven dependency on aws-sdk has been changed to aws-sdk-s3 and the version bumped. Applications depending on transitive dependencies pulled in by aws-sdk and not aws-sdk-s3 might not work.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8900">HDFS-8900</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Compact XAttrs to optimize memory footprint.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The config key &quot;dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattr-size&quot; can no longer be set to a value of 0 (previously used to indicate unlimited) or a value greater than 32KB. This is a constraint on xattr size similar to many local filesystems.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8890">HDFS-8890</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Allow admin to specify which blockpools the balancer should run on</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds a new blockpools flag to the balancer. This allows admins to specify which blockpools the balancer will run on. Usage: -blockpools &lt;comma-separated list of blockpool ids&gt; The balancer will only run on blockpools included in this list.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12384">HADOOP-12384</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add &quot;-direct&quot; flag option for fs copy so that user can choose not to create &quot;._COPYING_&quot; file</strong></li>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-8829">HDFS-8829</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF size configurable for DataTransferProtocol sockets and allow configuring auto-tuning</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HDFS-8829 introduces two new configuration settings: dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size and dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size. These settings can be used to control the socket send buffer and receive buffer sizes respectively on the DataNode for client-DataNode and DataNode-DataNode connections. The default values of both settings are 128KB for backwards compatibility. For optimum performance it is recommended to set these values to zero to enable the OS networking stack to auto-tune buffer sizes.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-313">YARN-313</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Add Admin API for supporting node resource configuration in command line</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After this patch, the feature to support NM resource dynamically configuration is completed, so that user can configure NM with new resource without bring NM down or decommissioned. Two CLIs are provided to support update resources on individual node or a batch of nodes: 1. Update resource on single node: yarn rmadmin -updateNodeResource [NodeID] [MemSize] [vCores] 2. Update resource on a batch of nodes: yarn rmadmin -refreshNodesResources, that reflect nodes' resource configuration defined in dynamic-resources.xml which is loaded by RM dynamically (like capacity-scheduler.xml or fair-scheduler.xml). The first version of configuration format is: &lt;configuration&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;yarn.resource.dynamic.nodes&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;h1:1234&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;yarn.resource.dynamic.h1:1234.vcores&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;16&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;yarn.resource.dynamic.h1:1234.memory&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;1024&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;/configuration&gt;</p>

</ul>
<p>HADOOP-12437 introduces two new configuration settings: hadoop.security.dns.interface and hadoop.security.dns.nameserver. These settings can be used to control how Hadoop service instances look up their own hostname and may be required in some multi-homed environments where hosts are configured with multiple hostnames in DNS or hosts files. They supersede the existing settings dfs.datanode.dns.interface and dfs.datanode.dns.nameserver.</p>

<p>Previously, the MR job will get failed if AM get restarted for some reason (like node failure, etc.) during its doing commit job no matter if AM attempts reach to the maximum attempts. In this improvement, we add a new API isCommitJobRepeatable() to OutputCommitter interface which to indicate if job's committer can do commitJob again if previous commit work is interrupted by NM/AM failures, etc. The instance of OutputCommitter, which support repeatable job commit (like FileOutputCommitter in algorithm 2), can allow AM to continue the commitJob() after AM restart as a new attempt.</p>
