<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6962">HDFS-6962</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>ACL inheritance conflicts with umaskmode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The original implementation of HDFS ACLs applied the client's umask to the permissions when inheriting a default ACL defined on a parent directory. This behavior is a deviation from the POSIX ACL specification, which states that the umask has no influence when a default ACL propagates from parent to child. HDFS now offers the capability to ignore the umask in this case for improved compliance with POSIX. This change is considered backward-incompatible, so the new behavior is off by default and must be explicitly configured by setting dfs.namenode.posix.acl.inheritance.enabled to true in hdfs-site.xml. Please see the HDFS Permissions Guide for further details.</p>
