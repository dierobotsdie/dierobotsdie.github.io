<h1 id="apache-hadoop-0.20.3-release-notes">Apache Hadoop 0.20.3 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6701">HADOOP-6701</a> | <em>Minor</em> | ** Incorrect exit codes for &quot;dfs -chown&quot;, &quot;dfs -chgrp&quot;**</li>
</ul>
<p>Commands chmod, chown and chgrp now returns non zero exit code and an error message on failure instead of returning zero.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6382">HADOOP-6382</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>publish hadoop jars to apache mvn repo.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The hadoop jars are renamed from previous hadoop-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;name&gt;.jar to hadoop-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.jar. Applications and documentation need to be updated to use the new file naming scheme.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-132">HDFS-132</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Namenode in Safemode reports to Simon non-zero number of deleted files during startup</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With this incompatible change, under metrics context &quot;dfs&quot;, the record name &quot;FSDirectory&quot; is no longer available. The metrics &quot;files_deleted&quot; from the deleted record &quot;FSDirectory&quot; is now available in metrics context &quot;dfs&quot;, record name &quot;namenode&quot; with the metrics name &quot;FilesDeleted&quot;.</p>
