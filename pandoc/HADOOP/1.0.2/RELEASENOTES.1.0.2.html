<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3851">MAPREDUCE-3851</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Allow more aggressive action on detection of the jetty issue</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>added new configuration variables to control when TT aborts if it sees a certain number of exceptions:</p>
<pre><code>// Percent of shuffle exceptions (out of sample size) seen before it&#39;s
// fatal - acceptable values are from 0 to 1.0, 0 disables the check.
// ie. 0.3 = 30% of the last X number of requests matched the exception,
// so abort.
  conf.getFloat(
      &quot;mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.catch.exception.percent.limit.fatal&quot;, 0);

// The number of trailing requests we track, used for the fatal
// limit calculation
  conf.getInt(&quot;mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.catch.exception.sample.size&quot;, 1000);</code></pre>
