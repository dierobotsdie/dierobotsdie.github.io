<h1 id="apache-hadoop-2.6.5-release-notes">Apache Hadoop 2.6.5 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12805">HADOOP-12805</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Annotate CanUnbuffer with @InterfaceAudience.Public</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Made CanBuffer interface public for use in client applications.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6622">MAPREDUCE-6622</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Add capability to set JHS job cache to a task-based limit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two recommendations for the mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size property: 1) For every 100k of cache size, set the heap size of the Job History Server to 1.2GB. For example, mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size=500000, heap size=6GB. 2) Make sure that the cache size is larger than the number of tasks required for the largest job run on the cluster. It might be a good idea to set the value slightly higher (say, 20%) in order to allow for job size growth.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4785">YARN-4785</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>inconsistent value type of the &quot;type&quot; field for LeafQueueInfo in response of RM REST API - cluster/scheduler</strong></li>
</ul>
