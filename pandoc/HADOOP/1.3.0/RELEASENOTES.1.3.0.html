<h1 id="apache-hadoop-1.3.0-release-notes">Apache Hadoop 1.3.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8873">HADOOP-8873</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Port HADOOP-8175 (Add mkdir -p flag) to branch-1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FsShell mkdir now accepts a -p flag. Like unix, mkdir -p will not fail if the directory already exists. Unlike unix, intermediate directories are always created, regardless of the flag, to avoid incompatibilities.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7312">HDFS-7312</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Update DistCp v1 to optionally not use tmp location (branch-1 only)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>DistCp v1 currently copies files to a temporary location and then renames that to the specified destination. This can cause performance issues on file systems such as S3. A -skiptmp flag is added to bypass this step and copy directly to the destination.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5685">HDFS-5685</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>DistCp will fail to copy with -delete switch</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Has dependency on MAPREDUCE-1285/MAPREDUCE-5698</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5777">MAPREDUCE-5777</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Support utf-8 text with BOM (byte order marker)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING: No release note provided for this incompatible change.</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5408">MAPREDUCE-5408</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>CLONE - The logging level of the tasks should be configurable by the job</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allow logging level of map/reduce tasks to be configurable. Configuration changes: add mapred.map.child.log.level add mapred.reduce.child.log.level</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4049">MAPREDUCE-4049</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>plugin for generic shuffle service</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allow ReduceTask loading a third party plugin for shuffle (and merge) instead of the default shuffle.</p>
