<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6995">HADOOP-6995</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Allow wildcards to be used in ProxyUsers configurations</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6453">HADOOP-6453</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Hadoop wrapper script shouldn't ignore an existing JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING: No release note provided for this incompatible change.</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2246">HDFS-2246</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Shortcut a local client reads to a Datanodes files directly</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>New configurations</li>
</ol>
<p>a. dfs.block.local-path-access.user is the key in datanode configuration to specify the user allowed to do short circuit read. b. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is the key to enable short circuit read at the client side configuration. c. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.skip.checksum is the key to bypass checksum check at the client side. 2. By default none of the above are enabled and short circuit read will not kick in. 3. If security is on, the feature can be used only for user that has kerberos credentials at the client, therefore map reduce tasks cannot benefit from it in general.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3725">MAPREDUCE-3725</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Hadoop 22 hadoop job -list returns user name as NULL</strong></li>
