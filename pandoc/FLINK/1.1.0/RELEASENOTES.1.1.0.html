<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3608">FLINK-3608</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>ImmutableSettings error in ElasticsearchSink</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying to use ElasticsearchSink with Flink 0.10.2 and Elasticsearch 2.2.0, and I'm having the following error:</p>
<p>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/elasticsearch/common/settings/ImmutableSettings at org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSink.open(ElasticsearchSink.java:177) at org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.util.FunctionUtils.openFunction(FunctionUtils.java:36) at org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.AbstractUdfStreamOperator.open(AbstractUdfStreamOperator.java:89) at org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.tasks.StreamTask.openAllOperators(StreamTask.java:286) at org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.tasks.StreamTask.invoke(StreamTask.java:213) at org.apache.flink.runtime.taskmanager.Task.run(Task.java:584) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)</p>
<p>The problem seems to be the use of the class ImmutableSettings, that has been removed since Elastisearch 2.0. I imagine that with previous versions of Elasticsearch (i.e: 1.7.1) it will work correctly.</p>

<p>Thanks in advanced,</p>
