<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3292">FLINK-3292</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Bug in flink-jdbc. Not all JDBC drivers supported</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In method open in JDBCInputFormat.java, while using dbConn.createStatement, the resultSetType &amp; resultSetConcurrency are hardcoded. These two fields may vary with different JDBC drivers &amp; hence it fails in a few cases like SAP HANA Jdbc driver. There are two variants of the method dbCon.createStatement, one with parameters &amp; the other without parameters. Both should be supported.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; regards, Subhobrata</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3271">FLINK-3271</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Using webhdfs in a flink topology throws classnotfound exception</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I was just trying to run a storm topology on flink using flink-storm. I got this exception -</p>
<p>{noformat} Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/mortbay/util/ajax/JSON at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem.jsonParse(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:325) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem$FsPathResponseRunner.getResponse(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:727) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem$AbstractRunner.runWithRetry(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:610) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem$AbstractRunner.access$100(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:458) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem$AbstractRunner$1.run(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:487) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at javax.security.auth.Subject.doAs(Subject.java:422) at org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.doAs(UserGroupInformation.java:1628) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem$AbstractRunner.run(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:483) at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.web.WebHdfsFileSystem.listStatus(WebHdfsFileSystem.java:1277) {noformat}</p>
<p>My topology list some files on hdfs using webhdfs API. org.mortbay.util.ajax.JSON was included in the application uber jar. I noticed that flink loads the application jar in a child classloader. This is what most likely happened -</p>
<p>1. WebHdfsFileSystem class was loaded through parent class loader since it is included in flink-dist.jar. 2. WebHdfsFileSystem has reference to the org.mortbay.util.ajax.JSON but since it is loaded through parent class loader, WebHdfsFileSystem can't read a class in child class loader.</p>
<p>Ideally all the referenced classes should be available in the distribution jar so that these sort of issues may not occur.</p>
