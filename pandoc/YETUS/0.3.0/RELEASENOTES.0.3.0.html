<h1 id="apache-yetus-0.3.0-release-notes">Apache Yetus 0.3.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-337">YETUS-337</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Upgrade version of pylint used in Dockerfile</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The default precommit Dockerfile now relies on pip to grab an up-to-date version of pylint, rather than rely on the version shipped in dpkg.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-322">YETUS-322</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>flip verify_ result codes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This changes various verify_ functions such that 0 is always yes/true and 1 is always no/false. This should make it easier/more obvious what test is being performed in if statements. Be aware that this will likely break any personalities or plug-ins that were written against previous versions.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-300">YETUS-300</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>CHANGED_FILES, CHANGED_MODULES, etc should really be arrays</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>Users:</p>
<ul>
<li>precommit should now have much better support for source trees with files that have spaces in them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Devs:</p>
<ul>
<li>this patch completely changes CHANGED_FILES, CHANGED_MODULES, and USER_MODULES_LIST to be arrays instead of strings. Personalities, plug-ins, etc, that use these will need to be updated appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-303">YETUS-303</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>better sorting options for releasedocmaker</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Releasedocmaker now supports sorting issues based either on resolution date or issue id. The default remains the same: release date in oldest-first order.</p>
<p>See the docs for more information.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-326">YETUS-326</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make releasedocmaker.py lint filters configurable</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>Users of release doc maker can now specify which lint checks they would like used via the <code>--lint</code> command line arguement. Available options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;incompatible&quot; - issues flagged incompatible should have release notes</li>
<li>&quot;important&quot; - issues marked important should have release notes</li>
<li>&quot;version&quot; - issues should have a version string of the form <em>major</em>.<em>minor</em>.<em>other</em> or <em>description</em>-_revision</li>
<li>&quot;component&quot; - issues should specify a component</li>
<li>&quot;assignee&quot; - issues should have an assignee</li>
<li>&quot;all&quot; - all of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>For backwards compatibility, the <code>releasedocmaker</code> wrapper script included in the Yetus convenience binary will treat a bare <code>--lint</code> argument as <code>--lint=all</code>. Users that directly invoke the <code>releasedocmaker.py</code> python script will have to update their invocation.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-156">YETUS-156</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>[Umbrella] build driver</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>For users:</p>
<p>This patch adds the qbt (&quot;quality build tool&quot;) command in order to run test-patch as a regularly scheduled reporting tool against a source tree without the necessity of providing a patch file.</p>
<p>For Developers:</p>
<p>This feature has changed several internal structures and control mechanisms to be incompatible with previous releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, a text file was used add extra parameters onto the <code>docker run</code> command. Now this is done via the <code>DOCKER_EXTRAARGS[@]</code> variable.</li>
<li><code>BINNAME</code> now strips off the .sh extension.</li>
<li><code>PATCH_OR_ISSUE</code> and related vars may be empty when running in the full build mode.</li>
</ul>
