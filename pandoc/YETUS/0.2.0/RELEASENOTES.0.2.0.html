<h1 id="apache-yetus-0.2.0-release-notes">Apache Yetus 0.2.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-62">YETUS-62</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>add auto-formatting of usage options</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>test-patch and smart-apply-patch now have variable size output to match the screen dimensions when printing the usage information. As a result, the <code>plugin_usage</code> functions now use the <code>yetus_add_option</code> to add options to output. Plug-ins written to use raw echos will still work, but the output will be strange looking.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-241">YETUS-241</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>revamp parameterized site</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Website layout was changed to better accommodate multiple versions.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-187">YETUS-187</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>maven javac/javadoc can't use calcdiffs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The calcdiff function has been changed to be pluggable to allow for a variety of difference calculators to allow for greater accuracy when more information is available. As a result, this fixes some (but not all!) instances where pre-existing errors were reported as new in some reports.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-214">YETUS-214</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>release doc maker should have option to specify output directory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allow specifying of output directory in releasedocmaker</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-280">YETUS-280</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>build systems should be able to predetermine module order</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>Users: * Maven will now attempt to do a better job of determining the order with which modules should be handled.</p>
<p>Developers: * There is now a hook to allow build tools to re-order the module listing.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-173">YETUS-173</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>report fixed issues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is now code in place to allow for plug-ins to report a much more nuanced report in the form of an equation. This equation tells exactly how many new, unchanged, and fixed issues a patch causes/removes as well as the old and new totals for issues. For patches where the totals are unchanged, the generic &quot;passed&quot; message is returned. Summarization is automatically as appropriate turned off as well.</p>
<p>With this change, most plug-ins have been updated to report these numbers.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-70">YETUS-70</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>add support for make, including cmake and autoconf</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>User-facing:</p>
<ul>
<li>make, cmake, and autoconf are now supported build tools</li>
<li>ctest is now a supported test format</li>
<li>Dockerfile content has been slimmed down and enhanced to just what is needed to run Apache Yetus</li>
</ul>
<p>Developer-facing:</p>
<ul>
<li>BUILDTOOLCWD has changed in an incompatible way: instead of true/false it nows takes several different types of values. See documentation for more information</li>
<li><code>modules_workers</code> now supports @@@BASEDIR@@@@ and @@@MODULEDIR@@@ as replaceable parameters on the command line</li>
<li>New <code>buildtool_changed_modules</code> function support to allow build tools to change the module list</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-282">YETUS-282</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Allow the specification of a base JIRA URL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allow specification of the Base JIRA URL as a command line option</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-229">YETUS-229</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>split --jenkins up</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>User-impacting: * Docker 1.6.0 or higher is now required. * --robot has been added to provide the same functionality as the older --jenkins flags, but without the assumptions of actually running underneath Jenkins. * --jenkins is now effectively --robot + some specific handling in messages and instances when running under Jenkins. * --sentinel has been added to provide cleaning of non-Yetus-based Docker containers and images. It automatically enables --robot. * --dockerdelrep has been added to only print what would be cleaned in --robot, --jenkins, and --sentinel. * Options have been added to override the Jenkins-specific defaults for various settings:<br />
* --build-url to provide the base URL of the robot's web server * --build-url-console to provide the relative URL to the console for this run * --build-url-patchdir to provide the relative URL to the patch directory * --instance to provide a string for parallelization differentiation * --console-urls option has been added to print locations using the --build-url on the console instead of absolute file system locations. This is useful when looking at the test-patch console via something like the Jenkins console so that locations become clickable. * In rare situations, Docker images may not have been unique per run. This should now be fixed. * The time reported for switching execution modes (reexec and docker) were missing. This should now be fixed. * If --docker was the last option on the command line, it was not being removed when test-patch was being re-invoked inside the container. This should now be fixed. * test-patch is now much better about telling you what options have been turned on. This is useful when looking at test-patch's console when the actual command line options may not be visible. * Hadoop personality no longer has special options to run outside of it's Dockerfile on the ASF Jenkins. * The default project is now set to 'unknown'.</p>
<p>Dev-impacting: * A ton of Docker-specific arg handling has been moved out of test-patch and into docker.sh, where it really belongs. * This removes a lot more hard-coded, ASF-specific Jenkins setup bits. In some cases it was simply removed and in others, configurable. * New EXEC_MODES may be manipulated via the standard yetus_add_entry to list additional modes that test-patch may be running under. Note that this gets printed to the screen <em>very</em> soon in the bootstrap process.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-144">YETUS-144</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>mvn install usually required on mvn builds</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Plug-ins that use maven services should now use maven_add_install to be certain that a mvn install has been executed prior to their plug-in. This will help guarantee that all root-level maven dependencies have been satisfied. See the build system documentation for more information.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-285">YETUS-285</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>flag to enable/disable docker privileged mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Yetus now runs docker in privileged execution mode (when docker support is enabled).</p>
<p>To opt instead for the previous behavior, use the cli option {{--dockerprivd=false}}.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YETUS-297">YETUS-297</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>when verify_multijdk_test is no, use JAVA_HOME, not JDK_DIR_LIST</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>For downstream users:</p>
<p>The cli for configuring which tests should be run during Multi-JDK mode now works correctly. e.g. &quot;--multijdktests=compile&quot; will cause just compilation against additional jdk versions.</p>
<p>Note that the full suite of tests is always run against the java version given in JAVA_HOME.</p>
<p>For plugin developers:</p>
<p>Authors of new plugins that wish to make them multi-jdk aware can add them to the default list by calling the <code>yetus_add_entry</code> function. i.e.:</p>
<p><code>bash yetus_add_entry JDK_TEST_LIST my_foo_test</code></p>
