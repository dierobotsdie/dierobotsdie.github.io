<h1 id="apache-kafka-0.9.1.0-release-notes">Apache Kafka 0.9.1.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3044">KAFKA-3044</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Consumer.poll doesnot return messages when poll interval is less</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking to particular position in consumer and starting poll with timeout param 0 the consumer does not come back with data though there is data published via a producer already. If the timeout is increased slowly in chunks of 100ms then at 700ms value the consumer returns back the record on first call to poll.</p>
<p>Docs [http://kafka.apache.org/090/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#poll(long)] for poll reads if timeout is 0 then data will be returned immediately but the behaviour seen is that data is not returned.</p>
<p>The test code I am using can be found here https://gist.github.com/praveend/013dcab01ebb8c7e2f2d</p>
<p>I have created a topic with data published as below and then running the test program [ConsumerPollTest.java]</p>
<p>$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic mytopic $ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic mytopic Hello Hai bye $ java ConsumerPollTest</p>
<p>I have published this 3 lines of data to kafka only once....later on I just use the above program with different poll interval</p>
<p>Let me know if I am missing anything and interpreting it wrongly.</p>
