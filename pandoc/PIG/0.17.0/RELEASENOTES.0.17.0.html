<h1 id="apache-pig-0.17.0-release-notes">Apache Pig 0.17.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4906">PIG-4906</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Add Bigdecimal functions in Over function</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>-4 new functions: SUM, AVG, MAX and MIN for BigDecimal and 4 test for each function. -An another outputschema. This output takes the inner alias and type of inputschema and returns the same alias with &quot;_over&quot; and the type. This is because in a foreach like the next:</p>
<p>x = FOREACH SUM { ini = FOREACH test GENERATE id, id_2; GENERATE FLATTEN(MYSTITCH(ini, MYOVER(test.impt_prima, 'sum(bigdecimal)'), MYOVER(test.impt_1, 'sum(bigdecimal)'), MYOVER(test.impt_2, 'sum(bigdecimal)')));</p>
<p>with the normal OVER function the foreach fails because all MYOVERS return the same alias.</p>
