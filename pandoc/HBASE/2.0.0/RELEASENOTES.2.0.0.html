<h1 id="apache-hbase-2.0.0-release-notes">Apache HBase 2.0.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9049">HBASE-9049</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Generalize ServerCallable creation to support custom callables</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Support custom RpcRetryingCaller via a configurable factory.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9745">HBASE-9745</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Append HBASE_CLASSPATH to end of Java classpath and use another env var for prefix</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- The additional JAR files specified with HBASE_CLASSPATH are appended to the system JARs. - The additional JAR files specified with HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX are prefixed to the system JARs.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11059">HBASE-11059</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>ZK-less region assignment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This patch makes it possible to do region assignment without ZK. By default, it is off (i.e. ZK is used for region assignment as before).</p>
<p>Two setting &quot;hbase.assignment.usezk&quot;, &quot;hbase.assignment.usezk.migrating&quot; are introduced to control migration from using ZK for assignment to not using ZK for assignment.</p>
<p>For rolling upgrade from using ZK to not using ZK, it can be done in two steps:</p>
<p>1. Set both hbase.assignment.usezk and hbase.assignment.usezk.migrating to true, do a rolling upgrade so that both masters and regionservers have the new code. Either master or regionserver can be upgraded at first. The order is not important for this step. If you want to keep using ZK for assignment, you'd better set hbase.assignment.usezk to true, and hbase.assignment.usezk.migrating to false so that region states are not persisted in meta table.</p>
<p>2. Set hbase.assignment.usezk to false, do a rolling restart so that region assignments don't use ZK any more. For this step, masters should be restarted after regionservers have all restarted at first so that they won't update meta table directly and master doesn't know about it.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11372">HBASE-11372</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Remove SlabCache</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>SlabCache is no longer support. For off-heap blockcache needs, please see BucketCache.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11344">HBASE-11344</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Hide row keys and such from the web UIs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Configure &quot;hbase.display.keys&quot; to false (default: true) in the master/regionservers if the row-keys should be hidden in the webUIs (like in the webUI for table details).</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10885">HBASE-10885</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>Support visibility expressions on Deletes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Deletes can be specified with Cell Visibility as done for puts. Cells covered by the delete is found by doing pattern matching. A deleteFamily issued for row1, f1 with Cell Visibility (A &amp; B) would delete only those cells of row1 under family f1 which has cell visibility A&amp;B or B&amp;A. A delete without any cell visibility would only delete those cells that does not have any cell visibility. In case of delete specific column with latest version only the latest cell with the specified cell visibility will be covered by the delete marker. In case there is no such cell with the specified cell visibility then no cell gets deleted.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11315">HBASE-11315</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Keeping MVCC for configurable longer time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After this patch, MVCC value of KVs will be kept for a configurable period &quot;hbase.hstore.compaction.keep.mvcc.period&quot;(default value is 5 days). The minimum setting of &quot;hbase.hstore.compaction.keep.mvcc.period&quot; is also set to 5 days and any user setting less than the min setting will be ignored.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11240">HBASE-11240</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Print hdfs pipeline when hlog's sync is slow</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds emission of a log message that lists datanodes in HDFS pipeline when sync is slow. Set when to log with &quot;hbase.regionserver.hlog.slowsync.ms&quot;. Defaults logging if sync takes &gt; 100ms.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11118">HBASE-11118</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>non environment variable solution for &quot;IllegalAccessError: class com.google.protobuf.ZeroCopyLiteralByteString cannot access its superclass com.google.protobuf.LiteralByteString&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The workaround documented in HBASE-10304 for running a mapreduce job with a &quot;fat jar&quot; is no longer required. Such applications can be launched without adding hbase-protocol.jar to the HADOOP_CLASSPATH.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11520">HBASE-11520</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Simplify offheap cache config by removing the confusing &quot;hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Remove &quot;hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache&quot;. Simplifies config of block cache. If you are using this config., after this patch goes in, it will be ignored. The L1 LruBlockCache will be whatever hfile.block.cache.size is set to and the L2 BucketCache will be whatever hbase.bucketcache.size is set to.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2251">HBASE-2251</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>PE defaults to 1k rows - uncommon use case, and easy to hit benchmarks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Added a --valueZipf to PE.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2217">HBASE-2217</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>VM OPTS for shell only</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Set HBASE_SHELL_OPTS in the environment or in hbase-env.sh to supply extra VM arguments when launching the HBase command shell.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11534">HBASE-11534</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Remove broken JAVA_HOME autodetection in hbase-config.sh</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This change removes old and increasingly useless JAVA_HOME autodetection that looks for Java 6 runtimes in various locations. Ensure that JAVA_HOME is correctly set in the environment before launching HBase daemons.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11548">HBASE-11548</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>[PE] Add 'cycling' test N times and unit tests for size/zipf/valueSize calculations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds --cycles=N argument.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11556">HBASE-11556</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Move HTablePool to hbase-thrift module.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HTablePool was deprecated in 0.98.1 but was still present and usable by apps built against versions before HBase 2.0. It has been moved and is not intended to be used by user applications, and is now an internal part of the thrift2 proxy server only.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11492">HBASE-11492</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Hadoop configuration overrides some ipc parameters including tcpNoDelay</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the Hadoop configuration is read after the HBase configuration, Hadoop's settings can override HBase's settings if the names of the settings are the same. To avoid the risk of override, HBase has renamed the following settings (by prepending 'hbase.') so that you can set them independent of your setting for Hadoop. If you do not use the HBase-specific variants, the Hadoop settings will be used.</p>

</ul>
<p>Removed unused classes</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3135">HBASE-3135</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make our MR jobs implement Tool and use ToolRunner so can do -D trickery, etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All MR jobs implement Tool Interface, http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/util/Tool.html, so now you can pass properties on command line with the -D flag, etc.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11606">HBASE-11606</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Enable ZK-less region assignment by default</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, we don't use ZK for region assignment now. To fall back to the old way, you can set hbase.assignment.usezk to true.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11558">HBASE-11558</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Caching set on Scan object gets lost when using TableMapReduceUtil in 0.95+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>TableMapReduceUtil now restores the option to set scanner caching by setting it on the Scan object that is passe in. The priority order for choosing the scanner caching is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Caching set on the scan object. 2. Caching specified via the config &quot;hbase.client.scanner.caching&quot;, which can either be set manually on the conf or via the helper method TableMapReduceUtil.setScannerCaching(). 3. The default value HConstants.DEFAULT_HBASE_CLIENT_SCANNER_CACHING, which is set to 100 currently.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11640">HBASE-11640</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add syntax highlighting support to HBase Ref Guide programlistings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This got committed, so I guess it is safe to resolve it?</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11323">HBASE-11323</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>BucketCache all the time!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use the LruBlockCache default if your data fits the blockcache. If block cache churn or you want a block cache that is immune to the vagaries of BC, deploy the offheap bucketcache. See http://people.apache.org/~stack/bc/</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11658">HBASE-11658</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Piped commands to hbase shell should return non-zero if shell command failed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds a noninteractive mode (-n or --noninteractive) to the hbase shell that exits with a non-zero error code on failed or invalid shell command executions, and exits with a zero error code upon successful execution.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11527">HBASE-11527</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Cluster free memory limit check should consider L2 block cache size also when L2 cache is onheap.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of the heap size % used by Memstore (Configured using 'hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size' and defaults to 40%) and the that of block cache (Configured using 'hfile.block.cache.size' and defaults to 40%) should leave enough heap size for other normal operations of RS. This is 20%. Also to be noted that when the L2 block cache (ie. Bucket cache) is configured to be on heap, the size of that also comes into this size math. So in that case the sum of memstore heap size, L1 block cache size and L2 cache size (Configured using 'hbase.bucketcache.size')can be at max 80%. When automatic tuning of heap memory is enabled (HBASE-5349) at point of time this 80% cap should hold.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11696">HBASE-11696</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make CombinedBlockCache resizable.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CombinedBlockCache is made resizable. See HBASE-5349 for auto resizing feature. On resize of this block cache, the L1 cache (ie. LRU cache) will get resized</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11657">HBASE-11657</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Put HTable region methods in an interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Add a RegionLocator Interface. Encapsulates 'region' operations. Implemented by HTable and you can get one from an HConnection.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11610">HBASE-11610</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Enhance remote meta updates</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds &quot;hbase.regionstatestore.meta.connection&quot; configuration and new MultiHConnection class. Is set to 1 by default. Set it higher if you want to run with more than one connection to the meta table. Useful if you have a very large meta table -- e.g. 1M regions -- otherwise, stick to the default.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11821">HBASE-11821</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>[ImportTSV] Abstract labels tags creation into pluggable Interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Added a facade org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CellCreator to create Cells for HFileOutputFormat. When working with HFileOutputFormat (with or with out visibility labels) in bulk load one can use this facade to make Cells with visibility tags. Also we allow plugin an implementation of org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.VisibilityExpressionResolver by configuring the the FQCN with key &quot;hbase.mapreduce.visibility.expression.resolver.class&quot;. The default implementation will tag Cells with visibility label ordinal.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11878">HBASE-11878</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>TestVisibilityLabelsWithDistributedLogReplay#testAddVisibilityLabelsOnRSRestart sometimes fails due to VisibilityController not yet initialized</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A new exception, VisibilityControllerNotReadyException, is introduced for the case where VisibilityController is being initialized. Client can respond to this exception by retrying prior operation. VisibilityControllerNotReadyException isn't a DoNotRetryIOException.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11440">HBASE-11440</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Make KeyValueCodecWithTags as the default codec for replication in trunk</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By default in master branch the replication would use a new type of codec that would always replicate Cells with tags. {code} {code} &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.replication.rpc.codec&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodecWithTags&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; {code}</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11919">HBASE-11919</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Remove the deprecated pre/postGet CP hook</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Removed the below 2 hooks from RegionObserver CP. These were deprecated since 0.96 and having replacement 1. preGet(final ObserverContext&lt;RegionCoprocessorEnvironment&gt; c, final Get get, final List&lt;KeyValue&gt; result) 2. postGet(final ObserverContext&lt;RegionCoprocessorEnvironment&gt; c, final Get get, final List&lt;KeyValue&gt; result) These are replaced with pre/postGetOp hooks</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11331">HBASE-11331</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>[blockcache] lazy block decompression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When hbase.block.data.cachecompressed=true, DATA (and ENCODED_DATA) blocks are cached in the BlockCache in their on-disk format. This is different from the default behavior, which decompresses and decrypts a block before caching.</p>
<p>For a region server hosting more data than fits into cache, enabling this feature with SNAPPY compression results in 50% increase in throughput and 30% improvement in mean latency while increasing GC by 80% and increasing overall CPU load by 2%.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11845">HBASE-11845</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>HFile tool should implement Tool, disable blockcache by default</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HFileTool now accepts configuration overrides in the usual way. Blockcache is disabled by default.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11897">HBASE-11897</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Add append and remove peer table-cfs cmds for replication</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds two new shell commands for operators to add and remove peers at the columnfamily scope.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11847">HBASE-11847</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>HFile tool should be able to print block headers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The HFileTool (`hbase hfile`) can print block headers. The flag is -h,--printblockheaders.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11805">HBASE-11805</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>KeyValue to Cell Convert in WALEdit APIs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The KeyValue based APIs in WALEdit is been removed and replaced with Cell based APIs void add(KeyValue) -&gt; void add(Cell) ArrayList&lt;KeyValue&gt; getKeyValues() -&gt; ArrayList&lt;Cell&gt; getCells()</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11911">HBASE-11911</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Break up tests into more fine grained categories</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds new test categories besides the class smalltests, mediumtests, and largetests. Adds:</p>
<p>ClientTests CoprocessorTests FilterTests FlakeyTests IOTests MapReduceTests MasterTests MiscTests RegionServerTests ReplicationTests RestTests SecurityTests VerySlowMapReduceTests VerySlowRegionServerTests</p>
<p>See description for examples on how to use them.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12054">HBASE-12054</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>bad state after NamespaceUpgrade with reserved table names</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to HBase 0.98.7, if you have 0.94 tables named (data, archive, corrupt, lib, WALs, splitWAl, oldWALs) upgrading would &quot;silently&quot; fail, corrupting the state of those tables.</p>

</ul>
<p>HBase internals for the write ahead log have been refactored. Advanced users of HBase should be aware of the following changes.</p>
<p>Public Audience - The Admin API for asking a region server to roll WAL files has changed from a synchronous command that returns a set of regions the WAL implementation would like flushed into an asynchronous command that returns nothing. Older clients relying on the former behavior will still be able to interact with newer servers, but the response body will always contain an empty list of regions to flush. - The shell command &quot;hlog_roll&quot; has been deprecated. Operators should use the &quot;wal_roll&quot; command instead. This command is subject to the changes described above for the Admin API to roll WAL files. - The command for analyzing write ahead logs has been renamed from 'hlog' to 'wal'. The old usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. - Some utility methods in the HBaseTesetingUtility related to testing write-ahead-logs were changed in incompatible ways. No functionality has been removed, but method names and arguments have changed. See the HBaseTestingUtility javadoc for details. - The WALPlayer utility has deprecated the configuration keys used for advanced customization. Users should switch to the updated configuration keys. See the usage information on the WALPlayer tool for details. - The HLogInputFormat utility class for processing logs with MapReduce has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Users should switch to the WALInputFormat. - The labeling of server metrics on the region server status pages changed. Previously, the number of backing files for the write ahead log was labeled 'Num. HLog Files'. If you wish to see this statistic now, please look for the label 'Num. WAL Files.' If you rely on JMX for these metrics, their location has not changed.</p>
<p>LimitedPrivate(COPROC) Audience, LimitedPrivate(PHOENIX) - The RegionObserver API has been updated. The changes are both binary and source backwards compatible for coprocessors that use the BaseRegionObserver class. For those that implement RegionObserver directly the changes are binary backwards compatible. Depending on the internals of future HBase versions, coprocessors using the deprecated API may not see all WAL related events. Users are strongly encouraged to update their use of the API; see the RegionObserver javadoc for details. - Classes related to reading WAL entries (ReaderBase, ProtobufLogReader, SequenceFileLogReader) have changed in a backwards incompatible way. Users who referenced HLog.Reader directly or HLog.Entry will have to update. These changes do not impact compatibility with extant wal files. - The WALObserver API has been updated. The changes are both binary and source backwards compatible for coprocessors that use the BaseWALObserver class. For those that implement WALObserver directly the changes are binary backwards compatible. Depending on the internals of future HBase versions, coprocessors using the deprecated API may not see all WAL related events. Users are strongly encouraged to update their use of the API; see the WALObserver javadoc for details. - The WALCoprocessorEnvironment has changed in a backwards incompatible way. WALObserver coprocessors that relied on retrieving an object representing the write ahead log instance will have to be updated.</p>
<p>LimitedPrivate(REPLICATION) Audience - The WALEntryFilter API has changed in a backwards incompatible way. Implementers will have to be updated. - The ReplicationEndpoint.ReplicateContext API has changed in a backwards incompatible way. Implementers who use this interface will have to be updated. These changes do not impact wire compatibility for replicating between clusters. - The HLogKey API is deprecated in favor of the WALKey API. Additionally, the HLogKey API has changed in a backwards incompatible way by changing from implementing WriteableComparable&lt;HLogKey&gt; to implementing Writeable and Comparable&lt;WALKey&gt;.</p>

<p>The system visibility label authorization for super users will no longer be persisted in hbase:labels table. Super users will be determined at server startup time.

If you have a prior deployment that had super users' system label persisted in hbase:labels, you can clean up by invoking the shell command 'clear_auths'.

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-5699">HBASE-5699</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Run with &gt; 1 WAL in HRegionServer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBase's write-ahead-log (WAL) can now be configured to use multiple HDFS pipelines in parallel to provide better write throughput for clusters by using additional disks. By default, HBase will still use only a single HDFS-based WAL.</p>
<p>To run with multiple WALs, alter the hbase-site.xml property &quot;hbase.wal.provider&quot; to have the value &quot;multiwal&quot;. To return to having HBase determine what kind of WAL implementation to use either remove the property all together or set it to &quot;defaultProvider&quot;.</p>
<p>Altering the WAL provider used by a particular RegionServer requires restarting that instance. RegionServers using the original WAL implementation and those using the &quot;multiwal&quot; implementation can each handle recovery of either set of WALs, so a zero-downtime configuration update is possible through a rolling restart.</p>

<p>Adds a configuration property &quot;hbase.regionserver.handler.abort.on.error.percent&quot; for aborting the region server when some of it's handler threads die. The default value is 0.5 causing an abort in the RS when half of it's handler threads die. A handler thread only dies in case of a serious software bug, or a non-recoverable Error (StackOverflow, OOM, etc) is thrown. These are possible values for the configuration: * -1 =&gt; Disable aborting * 0 =&gt; Abort if even a single handler has died * 0.x =&gt; Abort only when this percent of handlers have died * 1 =&gt; Abort only all of the handers have died</p>

</ul>
<p>MultiRowRangeFilter is a filter to support scanning multiple row key ranges. If the number of the ranges is small, using multiple scans can also do the same thing and can work well. But when the number of ranges are quite big (e.g. millions), use the MultiRowRangeFilter will be nice. In this filter, the ranges will be sorted and merged, so users do not have to take care of ranges are not continuous. And if users are using something like rest, thrift or pig to access the data the filter might be the practical solution.</p>

</ul>
<p>For users on a version of Hadoop that supports tiered storage policies (i.e. Apache Hadoop 2.6.0+), HBase now allows users to opt-in to having the write ahead log placed on the SSD tier. Users on earlier versions of Hadoop will be unable to take advantage of this feature.</p>

</ul>
<p>In our pre-1.0 API, HTable is considered a light-weight object that consumed by a single thread at a time. The HTablePool class provided a means of sharing multiple HTable instances across a number of threads. As an optimization, HTable managed a &quot;write buffer&quot;, accumulating edits and sending a &quot;batch&quot; all at once. By default the batch was sent as the last step in invocations of put(Put) and put(List&lt;Put&gt;). The user could disable the automatic flushing of the write buffer, retaining edits locally and only sending the whole &quot;batch&quot; once the write buffer has filled or when the flushCommits() method in invoked explicitly. Explicit or implicit batch writing was controlled by the setAutoFlushTo(boolean) method. A value of true (the default) had the write buffer flushed at the completion of a call to put(Put) or put(List&lt;Put&gt;). A value of false allowed for explicit buffer management. HTable also exposed the buffer to consumers via getWriteBuffer().</p>
<p>The combination of HTable with setAutoFlushTo(false) and the HTablePool provided a convenient mechanism by which multiple &quot;Put-producing&quot; threads could share a common write buffer. Both HTablePool and HTable are deprecated, and they are officially replaced in The new 1.0 API by Table and BufferedMutator. Table, which replaces HTable, no longer exposes explicit write-buffer management. Instead, explicit buffer management is exposed via BufferedMutator. BufferedMutator is made safe for concurrent use. Where code would previously retrieve and return HTables from an HTablePool, now that code creates and shares a single BufferedMutator instance across all threads.</p>

</ul>
<p>Namespace auditor provides basic quota support for namespaces in terms of number of tables and number of regions. In order to use namespace quotas, quota support must be enabled by setting &quot;hbase.quota.enabled&quot; property to true in hbase-site.xml file.</p>
<p>The users can add quota information to namespace, while creating new namespaces or by altering existing ones.</p>
<p>Examples: 1. create_namespace 'ns1', {'hbase.namespace.quota.maxregions'=&gt;'10'} 2. create_namespace 'ns2', {'hbase.namespace.quota.maxtables'=&gt;'2','hbase.namespace.quota.maxregions'=&gt;'5'} 3. alter_namespace 'ns3', {METHOD =&gt; 'set', 'hbase.namespace.quota.maxtables'=&gt;'5','hbase.namespace.quota.maxregions'=&gt;'25'}</p>
<p>The quotas can be modified/added to namespace at any point of time. To remove quotas, the following command can be used:</p>
<p>alter_namespace 'ns3', {METHOD =&gt; 'unset', NAME =&gt; 'hbase.namespace.quota.maxtables'} alter_namespace 'ns3', {METHOD =&gt; 'unset', NAME =&gt; 'hbase.namespace.quota.maxregions'}</p>

<p>When checking visibility authorizations of a user, the server will include the visibility authorizations of the groups of which the user is a member, together with the user's own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, get_auths 'user1' will only get user1's own visibility authorizations. clear_auths 'user1' will only clear user1's own visibility authorizations. The visibility authorizations of a group can be changed by invoking the API or command on the '@group1' itself.</p>

Default is org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.compactions.PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController, will limit throughput as follow: 1. In off peak hours, use a fixed limitation &quot;hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.offpeak&quot; (default is Long.MAX_VALUE which means no limitation). 2. In normal hours, the limitation is tuned between &quot;hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.lower.bound&quot;(default 10MB/sec) and &quot;hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.higher.bound&quot;(default 20MB/sec), using the formula &quot;lower + (higer - lower) * param&quot; where param is in range [0.0, 1.0] and calculate based on store files count on this regionserver. 3. If some stores have too many store files(storefilesCount &gt; blockingFileCount), then there is no limitation no matter peak or off peak. You can set &quot;hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller&quot; to org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.throttle.NoLimitThroughputController to disable throughput controlling.

</ul>
<p>Adds buffer reuse sending Cell results. It is on by default and should not need configuration. Improves GC profile and ups throughput. The benefit gets better the larger the row size returned.</p>
<p>The buffer reservoir is bounded at a maximum count after which we will start logging at WARN level that the reservoir is running at capacity (returned buffers will be discarded and not added back to the reservoir pool). Default maximum is twice the handler count: i.e. 2 * hbase.regionserver.handler.count. This should be more than enough. Set the maximum with the new configuration: hbase.ipc.server.reservoir.max</p>
<p>The reservoir will not cache buffers in excess of hbase.ipc.server.reservoir.max.buffer.size The default is 10MB. This means that if a row is very large, then we will allocate a buffer of the average size that is currently in the pool and we will then resize it till we can accommodate the return. These resizes are expensive. The resultant buffer will be used and then discarded.</p>
<p>To check how the reservoir is doing, enable trace level logging for a few seconds on a regionserver. You can do this from the regionserver UI. See 'Log Level'. Set org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.BoundedByteBufferPool to TRACE. The BoundedByteBufferPool will spew report to the log. Disable the TRACE level and then check the log. You'll see allocation rate, size of pool, size of buffers in pool, etc.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13090">HBASE-13090</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Progress heartbeats for long running scanners</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, there was no way to enforce a time limit on scan RPC requests. The server would receive a scan RPC request and take as much time as it needed to accumulate enough results to reach a limit or exhaust the region. The problem with this approach was that, in the case of a very selective scan, the processing of the scan could take too long and cause timeouts client side.</p>
<p>With this fix, the server will now enforce a time limit on the execution of scan RPC requests. When a scan RPC request arrives to the server, a time limit is calculated to be half of whichever timeout value is more restictive between the configurations (&quot;hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period&quot; and &quot;hbase.rpc.timeout&quot;). When the time limit is reached, the server will return whatever results it has accumulated up to that point. The results may be empty.</p>
<p>To ensure that timeout checks do not occur too often (which would hurt the performance of scans), the configuration &quot;hbase.cells.scanned.per.heartbeat.check&quot; has been introduced. This configuration controls how often System.currentTimeMillis() is called to update the progress towards the time limit. Currently, the default value of this configuration value is 10000. Specifying a smaller value will provide a tighter bound on the time limit, but may hurt scan performance due to the higher frequency of calls to System.currentTimeMillis().</p>
<p>Protobuf models for ScanRequest and ScanResponse have been updated so that heartbeat support can be communicated. Support for heartbeat messages is specified in the request sent to the server via ScanRequest.Builder#setClientHandlesHeartbeats. Only when the server sees that ScanRequest#getClientHandlesHeartbeats() is true will it send heartbeat messages back to the client. A response is marked as a heartbeat message via the boolean flag ScanResponse#getHeartbeatMessage</p>

</ul>
<p>In HBase 1.1.0 and above we have upgraded the version of Jackson dependencies (jackson-core-asl, jackson-mapper-asl, jackson-jaxrs and jackson-xc) from 1.8.8 to 1.9.13. This is to follow the upgrade to Jackson 1.9.13 in Hadoop 2.5 and above which causes Jackson class incompatibility for HBase as reported in HBASE-13149. Refer to HADOOP-10104 and YARN-2092 for additional information. Jackson1.9.13 is not completely backward compatible with the prior version 1.8.8 used in HBase. See the Compatibility reports attached in HBASE-13149 and http://svn.codehaus.org/jackson/trunk/release-notes/VERSION for more information.</p>
<p>This upgrade does not have direct impact on HBase users and HBase applications in most cases. In the rare case where your HBase application uses Jackson directly AND your application has compatibility issue with Jackson 1.9.13, you can do the following to mitigate the problem.</p>
<p>1. If you are on Hadoop 2.5 or above, and your HBase application involves running Yarn jobs, we recommend you update your application to use Jackson 1.9.13. You may be able to explore classpath isolation options (e.g. HADOOP-10893) or have your own classpath isolation strategy that works for you, but the general recommendation is that you upgrade to Jackson 1.9.13. 2. You may choose to continue using Jackson 1.8.8 and not to use Jackson 1.9.13 in your classpath. You can also choose to replace the Jackson 1.9.13 jars in $HBASE_HOME/lib with 1.8.8 jars. It can work for you in the following cases: a) You are on a Hadoop version earlier than Hadoop 2.5, or b) You are on Hadoop 2.5 or above, but your HBase application does not involve running Yarn jobs. 3. You may experiment with further isolation using the shaded jars introduced with 1.1.0 via HBASE-13517.</p>
<p>Note that it may not be tested or guaranteed that using Jackson 1.8.8 in $HBASE_HOME/lib will work in future HBase releases. It is recommended that your HBase application matches the Jackson version provided in HBase.</p>
<p>In HBase 0.98.x and HBase 1.0.x, we have NOT upgraded the version of Jackson dependencies. If you are on Hadoop 2.5 or above, and your HBase application involves running Yarn jobs, you may encounter Jackson class incomparability issue, as reported in HBASE-13149.</p>
<p>You can do the following to mitigate the problem: 1. Use 'hadoop jar' command to run your HBase jobs. 2. Explore classpath isolation options (e.g. HADOOP-10893) or have your own classpath isolation strategy that works for you. 3. You can also choose to replace the Jackson 1.8.8 jars in $HBASE_HOME/lib with 1.9.13 jars from your Hadoop lib directory. We have tested HBase 0.98 with Jackson 1.9.13.</p>

</ul>
<p>MOTIVATION</p>
<p>A pipelined scan API is introduced for speeding up applications that combine massive data traversal with compute-intensive processing. Traditional HBase scans save network trips through prefetching the data to the client side cache. However, they prefetch synchronously: the fetch request to regionserver is invoked only when the entire cache is consumed. This leads to a stop-and-wait access pattern, in which the client stalls until the next chunk of data is fetched. Applications that do significant processing can benefit from background data prefetching, which eliminates this bottleneck. The pipelined scan implementation overlaps the cache population at the client side with application processing. Namely, it issues a new scan RPC when the iteration retrieves 50% of the cache. If the application processing (that is, the time between invocations of next()) is substantial, the new chunk of data will be available before the previous one is exhausted, and the client will not experience any delay. Ideally, the prefetch and the processing times should be balanced.</p>
<p>API AND CONFIGURATION</p>
<p>Asynchronous scanning can be configured either globally for all tables and scans, or on per-scan basis via a new Scan class API.</p>
<p>Configuration in hbase-site.xml: hbase.client.scanner.async.prefetch, default false:</p>
<p>&lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.client.scanner.async.prefetch&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt;</p>
<p>API - Scan#setAsyncPrefetch(boolean)</p>
<pre><code>  Scan scan = new Scan\(\);
  scan\.setCaching\(1000\);
  scan\.setMaxResultSize\(BIG\_SIZE\);
  scan\.setAsyncPrefetch\(true\);
    \.\.\.
  ResultScanner scanner = table\.getScanner\(scan\);</code></pre>
<p>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</p>
<p>Pipelined scan is implemented by a new ClientAsyncPrefetchScanner class, which is fully API-compatible with the synchronous ClientSimpleScanner. ClientAsyncPrefetchScanner is not instantiated in case of small (Scan#setSmall) and reversed (Scan#setReversed) scanners. The application is responsible for setting the prefetch size in a way that the prefetch time and the processing times are balanced. Note that due to double buffering, the client side cache can use twice as much memory as the synchronous scanner.</p>
<p>Generally, this feature will put more load on the server (higher fetch rate -- which is the whole point). Also, YMMV.</p>

<p>If the master went to assign a region concurrent with a RegionServer abort, the returned RegionServerAbortedException was being handled as though the region had been cleanly offlined so assign was allowed proceed. If the region was opened in its new location before WAL replay completion, the replayed edits were ignored, worst case, or were later played over the top of edits that had come in since open and so susceptible to overwrite. In either case, DATALOSS.</p>

<p>Tool to sync two tables that tries to send the differences only like rsync.</p>

<p>From comments below, &quot;It can be challenging to run against a table getting live writes, if those writes are updates/overwrites. In general, you can run it against a time range to ignore new writes, but if those writes update existing cells, then the time range scan may or may not see older versions of those cells depending on whether major compaction has happened, which may be different in remote clusters.&quot;</p>

</ul>
<p>We try to delay the eviction of the block till the cellblocks are formed at the Rpc layer. A simple reference counting mechanism is introduced when ever a block is accessed from the Bucket cache. Once a scanner completes using a block the reference count is decremented. The eviction of the block happens only when the reference count of that block is 0. We also introduce a concept of ShareableMemory based on the type of blocks we create from the Block cache. The blocks from the ByteBufferIOEngine directly refer to the buckets in offheap and such blocks are marked SHARED memory type. The blocks from LRU, HDFS and file mode of Bucket cache are all marked EXCLUSIVE because these blocks have their own exclusive memory. For the CP case, any cell coming out of SHARED memory block is copied before returning the results, because CPs can use the results as its state so that eviction cannot corrupt the results.</p>

<p>This change augments existing chaos monkey framework with actions for restarting underlying zookeeper quorum and hdfs nodes of distributed hbase cluster. One assumption made while creating zk actions are that zookeper ensemble is an independent external service and won't be managed by hbase cluster. For these actions to work as expected, the following parameters need to be configured appropriately.</p>
<p>{code} &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.home&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;$HADOOP_HOME&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.home&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;$ZOOKEEPER_HOME&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.it.clustermanager.hbase.user&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;hbase&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.hdfs.user&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;hdfs&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.user&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;zookeeper&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt; {code}</p>

</ul>
<p>Tighten up WAL-use semantic.</p>
<p>1. If an append or a sync throws an exception, all subsequent attempts at using the log will also throw this same exception. The WAL is now a lame-duck until you roll it. 2. If a successful append, and then we fail to sync the append, this is a fatal exception. The container must abort to replay the WAL logs even though we have told the client that the appends failed.</p>
<p>The above rules have been applied laxly up to this; it used to be possible to get a good sync to go in over the top of a failed append. This has been fixed in this patch.</p>
<p>Also fixed a hang in the WAL subsystem if a request to pause the write pipeline took on a failed sync. before the roll requests sync got scheduled.</p>
<p>TODO: Revisit our WAL system. HBASE-12751 helps rationalize our write pipeline. In particular, it manages sequenceid inside mvcc which should make it so we can purge mechanism that writes empty, unflushed appends just to get the next sequenceid... problematic when WAL goes lame-duck. Lets get it in. TODO: A successful append followed by a failed sync probably only needs us replace the WAL (if we have signalled the client that the appends failed). Bummer is that replicating, these last appends might make it to the sink cluster or get replayed during recovery. HBase should keep its own WAL length? Or sequenceid of last successful sync should be passed when doing recovery and replication?</p>

</ul>
<p>This enhances the HBase replication to support replication of bulk loaded data. This is configurable, by default it is set to false which means it will not replicate the bulk loaded data to its peer(s). To enable it set &quot;hbase.replication.bulkload.enabled&quot; to true.</p>
<p>Following are the additional configurations added for this enhancement, a. hbase.replication.cluster.id - This is manadatory to configure in cluster where replication for bulk loaded data is enabled. A source cluster is uniquely identified by sink cluster using this id. This should be configured in the source cluster configuration file for all the RS. b. hbase.replication.conf.dir - This represents the directory where all the active cluster's file system client configurations are defined in subfolders corresponding to their respective replication cluster id in peer cluster. This should be configured in the peer cluster configuration file for all the RS. Default is HBASE_CONF_DIR. c. hbase.replication.source.fs.conf.provider - This represents the class which provides the source cluster file system client configuration to peer cluster. This should be configured in the peer cluster configuration file for all the RS. Default is org.apache.hadoop.hbase.replication.regionserver.DefaultSourceFSConfigurationProvider</p>
<p>For example: If source cluster FS client configurations are copied in peer cluster under directory /home/user/dc1/ then hbase.replication.cluster.id should be configured as dc1 and hbase.replication.conf.dir as /home/user</p>
<p>Note: a. Any modification to source cluster FS client configuration files in peer cluster side replication configuration directory then it needs to restart all its peer(s) cluster RS with default hbase.replication.source.fs.conf.provider. b. Only 'xml' type files will be loaded by the default hbase.replication.source.fs.conf.provider.</p>
<p>As part of this we have made following changes to LoadIncrementalHFiles class which is marked as Public and Stable class, a. Raised the visibility scope of LoadQueueItem class from package private to public. b. Added a new method loadHFileQueue, which loads the queue of LoadQueueItem into the table as per the region keys provided.</p>

</ul>
<p>The HBase region server will now send a chunk of get responses to a client if the total response size is too large. This will only be done for clients 1.2.0 and beyond. Older clients by default will have the old behavior.</p>
<p>This patch is for the case where the basic flow is like this:</p>
<p>I want to get a single column from lots of rows. So I create a list of gets. Then I send them to table.get(List&lt;Get&gt;). If the regions for that table are spread out then those requests get chunked out to all the region servers. No one regionserver gets too many. However if one region server contains lots of regions for that table then a multi action can contain lots of gets. No single get is too onerous. However the regionserver won't return until every get is complete. So if there are thousands of gets that are sent in one multi then the regionserver can retain lots of data in one thread.</p>

</ul>
<p>Rolling WAL events across a cluster can be highly correlated, hence flushing memstores, hence triggering minor compactions, that can be promoted to major ones. These events are highly correlated in time if there is a balanced write-load on the regions in a table. Default value for maximum WAL files (* hbase.regionserver.maxlogs*), which controls WAL rolling events - 32 is too small for many modern deployments. Now we calculate this value dynamically (if not defined by user), using the following formula:</p>
<p>maxLogs = Math.max( 32, HBASE_HEAP_SIZE * memstoreRatio * 2/ LogRollSize), where</p>
<p>memstoreRatio is *hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size* LogRollSize is maximum WAL file size (default 0.95 * HDFS block size)</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we avoid fully or minimize events when RS has to flush memstores prematurely only because it reached artificial limit of hbase.regionserver.maxlogs, this is why we put this 2 x multiplier in equation, this gives us maximum WAL capacity of 2 x RS memstore-size.</p>
<p>Runaway WAL files.</p>
<p>The default log rolling period (1h) allows to accumulate up to 2 X Memstore Size data in a WAL. For heap size - 32G and all other default setting, this gives ~ 26GB of data. Under heavy write load, the number of WAL files can increase dramatically. RegionServer LogRoller will be archiving old WALs periodically. User has three options, either override default hbase.regionserver.maxlogs or override default hbase.regionserver.logroll.period (decrease), or both to control runaway WALs.</p>
<p>For system with bursty write load, the hbase.regionserver.logroll.period can be decreased to lower value. In this case the maximum number of wal files will be defined by the total size of memstore (unflushed data), not by the hbase.regionserver.maxlogs. But for majority of applications there will be no issues with defaults. Data will be flushed periodically from memstore, the LogRoller will archive old wal files and the system will never reach the new defaults for hbase.regionserver.maxlogs, unless the system is under extreme load for prolonged period of time, but in this case, decreasing hbase.regionserver.logroll.period allows us to control runaway wal files.</p>
<p>The following table gives the new default maximum log files values for several different Region Server heap sizes:</p>
<p>heap memstore perc maxLogs 1G 40% 32 2G 40% 32 10G 40% 80 20G 40% 160 32G 40% 256</p>

<p>Limiting the amount of memory resident for any one request allows the server to handle concurrent requests smoothly. To this end we added the ability to limit the size of responses to a multi request. That worked well however it correctly represent the amount of memory resident. So this issue adds on a an approximation of the number of blocks held for a request.</p>
<p>All clients before 1.2.0 will not get this multi request chunking based upon blocks kept. All clients 1.2.0 and after will.</p>

</ul>
<p>This release note tries to tell the general story. Dive into sub-tasks for more specific release noting.</p>
<p>Increments, appends, checkAnd* have been slow since hbase-.1.0.0. The unification of mvcc and sequence id done by HBASE-8763 was responsible.</p>
<p>A ‘fast-path’ workaround was added by HBASE-15031 “Fix merge of MVCC and SequenceID performance regression in branch-1.0 for Increments”. It became available in 1.0.3 and 1.1.3. To enable the fast path, set &quot;hbase.increment.fast.but.narrow.consistency&quot; and then rolling restart. The workaround was for increments only (appends, checkAndPut, etc., were not addressed. See HBASE-15031 release note for more detail).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the regression was properly identified and fixed in HBASE-15213 and the fix applied to branch-1.0 and branch-1.1. As it happens, hbase-1.2.0 does not suffer from the performance regression (though the thought was that it did -- and so it got the fast-path patch too via HBASE-15092) nor does the master branch. HBASE-15213 identified that HBASE-12751 (as a side effect) had cured the regression.</p>
<p>hbase-1.0.4 (if it is ever released -- 1.0 has been end-of-lifed) and hbase-1.1.4 will have the HBASE-15213 fix. If you are suffering from the increment regression and you are on 1.0.3 or 1.1.3, you can enable the work around to get back your increment performance but you should upgrade.</p>

</ul>
<p>Checksumming is cpu intensive. HBase computes additional checksums for HFiles (hdfs does checksums too) and stores them inline with file data. During reading, these checksums are verified to ensure data is not corrupted. This patch tries to use Hadoop Native Library for checksum computation, if it’s available, otherwise falls back to standard Java libraries. Instructions to load NHL in HBase can be found here (http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hadoop.native.lib).</p>
<p>Default checksum algorithm has been changed from CRC32 to CRC32C primarily because of two reasons: 1) CRC32C has better error detection properties, and 2) New Intel processors have a dedicated instruction for crc32c computation (SSE4.2 instruction set)*. This change is fully backward compatible. Also, users should not see any differences except decrease in cpu usage. To keep old settings, set configuration ‘hbase.hstore.checksum.algorithm’ to ‘CRC32’.</p>
<p>* On linux, run 'cat /proc/cpuinfo’ and look for sse4_2 in list of flags to see if your processor supports SSE4.2.</p>

</ul>
<p>Date tiered compaction policy is a date-aware store file layout that is beneficial for time-range scans for time-series data.</p>
<p>When it performs well:</p>
<pre><code>reads for limited time ranges, especially scans of recent data</code></pre>
<p>When it doesn't perform as well:</p>
<pre><code>random gets without a time range
frequent deletes and updates
out of order data writes, especially writes with timestamps in the future
bulk loads of historical data</code></pre>
<p>Recommended configuration: To turn on Date Tiered Compaction (It is not recommended to turn on for the whole cluster because that will put meta table on it too and random get on meta table will be impacted): hbase.hstore.compaction.compaction.policy: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.compactions.DateTieredCompactionPolicy</p>
<p>Parameters for Date Tiered Compaction: hbase.hstore.compaction.date.tiered.max.storefile.age.millis: Files with max-timestamp smaller than this will no longer be compacted.Default at Long.MAX_VALUE. hbase.hstore.compaction.date.tiered.base.window.millis: base window size in milliseconds. Default at 6 hours. hbase.hstore.compaction.date.tiered.windows.per.tier: number of windows per tier. Default at 4. hbase.hstore.compaction.date.tiered.incoming.window.min: minimal number of files to compact in the incoming window. Set it to expected number of files in the window to avoid wasteful compaction. Default at 6. hbase.hstore.compaction.date.tiered.window.policy.class: the policy to select store files within the same time window. It doesn’t apply to the incoming window. Default at exploring compaction. This is to avoid wasteful compaction.</p>
<p>With tiered compaction all servers in the cluster will promote windows to higher tier at the same time, so using a compaction throttle is recommended: hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller:org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.compactions.PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController</p>
<p>Because there will most likely be more store files around, we need to adjust the configuration so that flush won't be blocked and compaction will be properly throttled: hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles: change to 50 if using all default parameters when turning on date tiered compaction. Use 1.5~2 x projected file count if changing the parameters, Projected file count = windows per tier x tier count + incoming window min + files older than max age</p>

<p>Previously RPC request scheduler in HBase had 2 modes in could operate in:</p>

It is an advanced feature for partitioning regionservers into distinctive groups for strict isolation, and should only be used by users who are sophisticated enough to understand the full implications and have a sufficient background in managing HBase clusters.</p>
<p>RSGroups can be defined and managed with shell commands or corresponding Java APIs. A server can be added to a group with hostname and port pair, and tables can be moved to this group so that only regionservers in the same rsgroup can host the regions of the table. RegionServers and tables can only belong to 1 group at a time. By default, all tables and regionservers belong to the &quot;default&quot; group. System tables can also be put into a group using the regular APIs. A custom balancer implementation tracks assignments per rsgroup and makes sure to move regions to the relevant regionservers in that group. The group information is stored in a regular HBase table, and a zookeeper-based read-only cache is used at the cluster bootstrap time.</p>

</ul>
<p>With this patch combined with HBASE-15389, when we compact, we can output multiple files along the current window boundaries. There are two use cases: 1. Major compaction: We want to output date tiered store files with data older than max age archived in trunks of the window size on the higher tier. Once a window is old enough, we don't combine the windows to promote to the next tier any further. So files in these windows retain the same timespan as they were minor-compacted last time, which is the window size of the highest tier. Major compaction will touch these files and we want to maintain the same layout. This way, TTL and archiving will be simpler and more efficient. 2. Bulk load files and the old file generated by major compaction before upgrading to DTCP.</p>
<p>This will change the way to enable date tiered compaction. To turn it on: hbase.hstore.engine.class: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.DateTieredStoreEngine</p>
<p>With tiered compaction all servers in the cluster will promote windows to higher tier at the same time, so using a compaction throttle is recommended: hbase.regionserver.throughput.controller:org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.compactions.PressureAwareCompactionThroughputController hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.higher.bound and hbase.hstore.compaction.throughput.lower.bound need to be set for desired throughput range as uncompressed rates.</p>
<p>Because there will most likely be more store files around, we need to adjust the configuration so that flush won't be blocked and compaction will be properly throttled: hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles: change to 50 if using all default parameters when turning on date tiered compaction. Use 1.5~2 x projected file count if changing the parameters, Projected file count = windows per tier x tier count + incoming window min + files older than max age</p>
<p>Because major compaction is turned on now, we also need to adjust the configuration for max file to compact according to the larger file count: hbase.hstore.compaction.max: set to the same number as hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14030">HBASE-14030</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>HBase Backup/Restore Phase 1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This experimental feature allows to perform backup/restore operations, including incremental ones, on a set of HBase tables.</p>
<p>Key features and Use Cases</p>
<p>A common practice of backup and restore in database is to first take full baseline backup, and then periodically take incremental backup that capture the changes since the full baseline backup. HBase cluster can store massive amount data. Therefore we want use full backup in combination with incremental backups for HBase as well. The following is a typical use case scenario for full and incremental backup:</p>
<p>● The user takes a full backup of a table or a set of tables in HBase. ● The user schedules periodical incremental backups to capture the changes from the full backup, or from last incremental backup. ● The user needs to restore table data to a past point in time. ● The full backup is restored to the table(s) or to different table name(s). Then the incremental backups that are up to the desired point in time are applied on top of the full backup. We would support the following key features and capabilities. ● Backup to DFS FileSystem across clusters and possibly to other storage media or servers. ● Support single table or a set of tables backup and restore (full and incremental). ● Restore to different table names and to different clusters. ● Support adding and removing tables to and from backup set without interruption of incremental backup schedule. ● Support merge of incremental backups into longer period and bigger incremental backups for easy storage and restore. ● Support scheduled backups. ● Unified command line interface for all the above.</p>
<p>To illustrate these key capabilities, the following are two more detailed use case examples.</p>
<p>Use case example 1:</p>
<p>1. User takes a full backup of a set of tables (i.e. table1 and table2) in HBase. 2. User takes incremental backups. The incremental backup will only track table1 and table2. 3. User adds other tables (i.e. table3 and table4) in HBase, and an implicit full backup is executed during the add process 4. User continues to take incremental backups. The incremental backup data would cover table1, table2, table3 and table4. 5. User wants to restore table3 and table4 to a past PIT (point-in-time). 6. Full backup in 3. is restored onto HBase cluster. Then the incremental backups after that full backup are applied on top of the full restore until the PIT.</p>
<p>Use case example 2:</p>
<p>1. User takes a full backup of a set of tables in HBase. 2. User takes daily incremental backups. 3. User merges the daily incremental backups into weekly incremental backups. 4. User combines/rolls up the weekly incremental backup into monthly incremental backups. 5. User wants to restore the tables to a past PIT. 6. Full backup is restored onto HBase cluster. 7. Monthly incremental backups before the desired PIT are applied. 8. Closest daily backups up to the PIT are applied.</p>
<p>To create full backup:</p>
<p>HBASE_DIR/bin/hbase backup create full &lt;backup_root_path&gt; [tables]</p>
<p>backup_root_path - path to backup root directory (file://, hdfs:// or any other Hadoop-compatible path) tables - list of tables, comma-separated. If no tables specified then all tables will be saved.</p>
<p>To create full backup:</p>
<p>HBASE_DIR/bin/hbase backup create incremental &lt;backup_root_path&gt; [tables]</p>
<p>backup_root_path - path to backup root directory (file://, hdfs:// or any other Hadoop-compatible path) tables - list of tables, comma-separated. If no tables specified then all tables will be saved.</p>
<p>To restore table(s):</p>
<p>HBASE_DIR/bin/hbase backup restore &lt;backup_root_path&gt; &lt;backup_id&gt; [tables]</p>
<p>backup_root_path - path to backup root directory (file://, hdfs:// or any other Hadoop-compatible path) backup_id - The id identifying the backup image. tables - list of tables, comma-separated.</p>
<p>FOR EXPERIENCED USERS only:</p>
<p>To get list of backup ids you will need to scan hbase:backup table using hbase shell or other means.</p>

</ul>
<p>Added a new ByteBufferPool which pools N ByteBuffers. By default it makes off heap ByteBuffers when getBuffer() is called. The size of each buffer defaults to 64KB. This can be configured using 'hbase.ipc.server.reservoir.initial.buffer.size'. The max number of buffers which can be pooled defaults to twice the number of handler threads in RS. This can be configured with key 'hbase.ipc.server.reservoir.initial.max'. While responding to read requests and client support Codec, we will create CellBlocks and directly return it as PB payload. For making this block, we will use N ByteBuffers from pool as per the total size of the response cells. The default size of 64 KB for the buffer is inline with the number of bytes written to RPC layer in one short.(That is also 64KB). When at point of time, the calle not able to get a free buffer from the pool (it returns null then), it will make on heap Buffer of same size (as that of Buffers in pool) and use that to create cell block.</p>

</ul>
<p>The estimates of heap usage by the memstore objects (KeyValue, object and array header sizes, etc) have been made more accurate for heap sizes up to 32G (using CompressedOops), resulting in them dropping by 10-50% in practice. This also results in less number of flushes and compactions due to &quot;fatter&quot; flushes. YMMV. As a result, the actual heap usage of the memstore before being flushed may increase by up to 100%. If configured memory limits for the region server had been tuned based on observed usage, this change could result in worse GC behavior or even OutOfMemory errors.

<p>This patch introduces a new infrastructure for creation and maintenance of Maven archetypes in the context of the hbase project, and it also introduces the first archetype, which end-users may utilize to generate a simple hbase-client dependent project.</p>
<p>NOTE that this patch should introduce two new WARNINGs (&quot;Using platform encoding ... to copy filtered resources&quot;) into the hbase install process. These warnings are hard-wired into the maven-archetype-plugin:create-from-project goal. See hbase/hbase-archetypes/README.md, footnote [6] for details.</p>
<p>After applying the patch, see hbase/hbase-archetypes/README.md for details regarding the new archetype infrastructure introduced by this patch. (The README text is also conveniently positioned at the top of the patch itself.)</p>

<p>Please note that if we turn this DBE on, HFile block will be bigger than NONE encoding because it adds some meta infos for binary search: /** * Store cells following every row's start offset, so we can binary search to a row's cells. * * Format: * flat cells * integer: number of rows * integer: row0's offset * integer: row1's offset * .... * integer: dataSize * */</p>

<p>HBase no longer includes Xerces implementation jars that were previously included via transitive dependencies. Downstream users relying on HBase for these artifacts will need to update their dependencies.</p>
