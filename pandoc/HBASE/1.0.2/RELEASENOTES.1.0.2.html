<h1 id="apache-hbase-1.0.2-release-notes">Apache HBase 1.0.2 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13983">HBASE-13983</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Doc how the oddball HTable methods getStartKey, getEndKey, etc. will be removed in 2.0.0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds extra doc on getStartKeys, getEndKeys, and getStartEndKeys in HTable explaining that they will be removed in 2.0.0 (these methods did not get the proper full major version deprecation cycle).</p>
<p>In this issue, we actually also remove these methods in master/2.0.0 branch.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13666">HBASE-13666</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>book.pdf is not renamed during site build</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Correct PDF renaming and bump version of maven-antrun-plugin</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13625">HBASE-13625</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Use HDFS for HFileOutputFormat2 partitioner's path</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Introduces a new config hbase.fs.tmp.dir which is a directory in HDFS (or default file system) to use as a staging directory for HFileOutputFormat2.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13564">HBASE-13564</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Master MBeans are not published</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To use the coprocessor-based JMX implementation provided by HBase for Master. Add below property in hbase-site.xml file:</p>
<p><property> <name>hbase.coprocessor.master.classes</name> <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.JMXListener</value> </property></p>
<p>NOTE: DO NOT set <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</code> for Java VM at the same time.</p>
<p>By default, the JMX listens on TCP port 10101 for Master, we can further configure the port using below properties:</p>
<p><property> <name>master.rmi.registry.port</name> <value>61110</value> </property> <property> <name>master.rmi.connector.port</name> <value>61120</value> </property> ----</p>
<p>The registry port can be shared with connector port in most cases, so you only need to configure master.rmi.registry.port. However if you want to use SSL communication, the 2 ports must be configured to different values.</p>
