<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15290">HBASE-15290</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Hbase Rest CheckAndAPI should save other cells along with compared cell</strong></li>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15354">HBASE-15354</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Use same criteria for clearing meta cache for all operations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This patch fixes some issues when MetaCache (region location cache) gets unnecessarily dropped on the client.</p>
<p>On master branch we now in RegionServerCallable and RegionServerAdminCallable pass the actual exception down to Connection#updateCachedLocation, so we could check there if the exception is &quot;meta-clearing&quot; or not.</p>
<p>on branch-1, branch-1.2 and branch 1.3 we now check if the exception is meta-clearing or not in AsyncProcess (this check was there on master, but not on earlier branches)</p>

</ul>
<p>Fixed an issue in REST server checkAndDelete operation where the remaining cells other than the to-be-checked column are also applied in the Delete operation. Also fixed an issue in RemoteHTable where the Delete object was not passed correctly to the REST server side.</p>
