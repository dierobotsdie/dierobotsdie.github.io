<h1 id="apache-hbase-1.3.1-release-notes">Apache HBase 1.3.1 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15386">HBASE-15386</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>PREFETCH_BLOCKS_ON_OPEN in HColumnDescriptor is ignored</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a non-issue. The PREFETCH_... flag actually works. While here though made the following additions.</p>
<p>Changes the prefetch TRACE-level loggings to include the word 'Prefetch' in them so you know what they are about.</p>
<p>Changes the cryptic logging of the CacheConfig#toString to have some preamble saying why and what column family is responsible (helps figure what is going on)</p>
<p>Add test that verifies setting flag on HColumnDescriptor actually works.</p>
