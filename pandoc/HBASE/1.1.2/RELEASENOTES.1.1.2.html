<h1 id="apache-hbase-1.1.2-release-notes">Apache HBase 1.1.2 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<p>Exclude Findbugs packages from shaded jars</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13959">HBASE-13959</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Region splitting uses a single thread in most common cases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of region splitting has been improved by using a thread pool to split the store files concurrently. Prior to this change, the store files were always split sequentially in a single thread, so a region with multiple store files ended up taking several seconds. The thread pool is sized dynamically with the aim of getting maximum concurrency, without exceeding the number of cores available for HBase Java process. A lower limit for the thread pool can be explicitly set using the property hbase.regionserver.region.split.threads.max.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13983">HBASE-13983</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Doc how the oddball HTable methods getStartKey, getEndKey, etc. will be removed in 2.0.0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds extra doc on getStartKeys, getEndKeys, and getStartEndKeys in HTable explaining that they will be removed in 2.0.0 (these methods did not get the proper full major version deprecation cycle).</p>
<p>In this issue, we actually also remove these methods in master/2.0.0 branch.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13895">HBASE-13895</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>DATALOSS: Region assigned before WAL replay when abort</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the master went to assign a region concurrent with a RegionServer abort, the returned RegionServerAbortedException was being handled as though the region had been cleanly offlined so assign was allowed proceed. If the region was opened in its new location before WAL replay completion, the replayed edits were ignored, worst case, or were later played over the top of edits that had come in since open and so susceptible to overwrite. In either case, DATALOSS.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13881">HBASE-13881</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Bug in HTable#incrementColumnValue implementation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBASE-13881 Correct HTable incrementColumnValue implementation</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13865">HBASE-13865</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>Increase the default value for hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multipler from 2 to 4 (part 2)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Increase default hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier from 2 to 4 in the code to match the default value in the config files.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14054">HBASE-14054</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Acknowledged writes may get lost if regionserver clock is set backwards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In {{checkAndPut}} write path use max(max timestamp for the row, System.currentTimeMillis()) in the, instead of blindly taking System.currentTimeMillis() to ensure that checkAndPut() cannot do writes which is already eclipsed. This is similar to what has been done in HBASE-12449 for increment and append.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13966">HBASE-13966</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Limit column width in table.jsp</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wraps region, start key, end key columns if too long.</p>
<hr />

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10844">HBASE-10844</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Coprocessor failure during batchmutation leaves the memstore datastructs in an inconsistent state</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Promotes an -ea assert to logged FATAL and RS abort when memstore is found to be in an inconsistent state.</p>
