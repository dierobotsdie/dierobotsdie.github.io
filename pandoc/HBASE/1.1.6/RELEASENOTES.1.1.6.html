<h1 id="apache-hbase-1.1.6-release-notes">Apache HBase 1.1.6 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15801">HBASE-15801</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Upgrade checkstyle for all branches</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All active branches now use maven-checkstyle-plugin 2.17 and checkstyle 6.18.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15811">HBASE-15811</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>Batch Get after batch Put does not fetch all Cells</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We were not waiting on all executors in a batch to complete which meant a read-your-own-writes could sometimes fail -- especially if client is loaded; i.e. putting to multiple machines in a cluster. The test for no-more-executors was damaged by the 0.99/0.98.4 fix &quot;HBASE-11403 Fix race conditions around Object#notify&quot;</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15856">HBASE-15856</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Cached Connection instances can wind up with addresses never resolved</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During periods where DNS resolution was not available or not working correctly, we could previously cache unresolved hostnames forever, in some cases preventing further connections to these hosts even when DNS service was restored. With this change, unresolved hostnames will no longer be cached, and will instead throw an UnknownHostException during connection setup.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15931">HBASE-15931</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Add log for long-running tasks in AsyncProcess</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After HBASE-15931, we will log more details for long-running tasks in AsyncProcess#waitForMaximumCurrentTasks every 10 seconds, including: 1. Table name will be included in the tasks status log 2. On which regionserver(s) the tasks are runnning will be logged when less than hbase.client.threshold.log.details tasks left, by default 10. 3. Against which regions the tasks are running will be logged when less than 2 tasks left.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16140">HBASE-16140</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>bump owasp.esapi from 2.1.0 to 2.1.0.1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The dependency owasp.esapi had a compatible change from 2.1.0 to 2.1.0.1. As a result, the transitive dependency commons-fileupload had a change from 1.2 to 1.3.1, which has some minor class changes that impact binary compatibility. Interested users should check the release notes of commons-fileupload to see if any of the incompatible changes impact them.</p>
<p>http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-fileupload/changes-report.html</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15925">HBASE-15925</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>compat-module maven variable not evaluated</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Downstream users of HBase dependencies that do not properly activate Maven profiles should now see a correct transitive dependency on the default hadoop-compatibility-module.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16144">HBASE-16144</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Replication queue's lock will live forever if RS acquiring the lock has died prematurely</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If zk based replication queue is used and useMulti is false, we will schedule a chore to clean up the orphan replication queue lock on zk.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16289">HBASE-16289</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>AsyncProcess stuck messages need to print region/server</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds logging of region and server. Helpful debugging. Logging now looks like this: {code} 2016-06-23 17:07:18,759 INFO [Thread-1] client.AsyncProcess$AsyncRequestFutureImpl(1601): #1, waiting for 1 actions to finish on table: DUMMY_TABLE 2016-06-23 17:07:18,759 INFO [Thread-1] client.AsyncProcess(1720): Left over 1 task(s) are processed on server(s): [s1:1,1,1] 2016-06-23 17:07:18,759 INFO [Thread-1] client.AsyncProcess(1728): Regions against which left over task(s) are processed: [DUMMY_TABLE,DUMMY_BYTES_1,1.3fd12ea80b4df621fb15497ba75f7368.,DUMMY_TABLE,DUMMY_BYTES_2,2.924207e242e313d2e5491c625e0a296e.] {code}</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16288">HBASE-16288</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>HFile intermediate block level indexes might recurse forever creating multi TB files</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A new hfile configuration &quot;hfile.index.block.min.entries&quot; which defaults to 16 determines how many entries the hfile index block can have at least. The configuration which determines how large the index block can be at max (hfile.index.block.max.size) is ignored as long as we have fewer than hfile.index.block.min.entries entries. This ensures that multi-level index does not build up with too many levels.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16317">HBASE-16317</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>revert all ESAPI changes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue reverts fixes designed to prevent malicious content from rendering in HBase's UIs. Specifically, these changes shipped in 1.1.4+ and 1.2.0+. They were removed due to licensing issues discovered in the dependencies they introduced. Their implementation and those dependencies have been removed from HBase! Removal of these dependencies is against the strict definition of our version compatibility guidelines. However, inclusion of non-Apache approved licenses cannot be tolerated. Implementation of these fixes using an Apache-appropriate means is tracked in HBASE-16328.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16321">HBASE-16321</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>Ensure findbugs jsr305 jar isn't present</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBase now ensures the jsr305 implementation from the findbugs project is not included in its binary artifacts or the compile / runtime dependencies of its user facing modules. Downstream users that rely on this jar will need to update their dependencies.</p>
