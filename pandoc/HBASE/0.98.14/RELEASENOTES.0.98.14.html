<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.98.14-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.98.14 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13963">HBASE-13963</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>avoid leaking jdk.tools</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBase now ensures that the JDK tools jar used during the build process is not exposed to downstream clients as a transitive dependency of hbase-annotations.</p>
<p>If you need to have the JDK tools jar in your classpath, you should add a system dependency on it. See the hbase-annotations pom for an example of the necessary pom additions.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13849">HBASE-13849</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Remove restore and clone snapshot from the WebUI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The HBase master status web page no longer allows operators to clone snapshots nor restore snapshots.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13666">HBASE-13666</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>book.pdf is not renamed during site build</strong></li>

<p>Correct PDF renaming and bump version of maven-antrun-plugin</p>
<hr />

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13646">HBASE-13646</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>HRegion#execService should not try to build incomplete messages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When RegionServerCoprocessors throw an exception we will no longer attempt to build an incomplete RPC response message. Instead, the response message will be null.</p>
