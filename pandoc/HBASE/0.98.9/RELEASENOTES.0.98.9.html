<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.98.9-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.98.9 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12619">HBASE-12619</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Backport HBASE-11639 (Replicate the visibility of Cells as strings) to 0.98</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allows the visibility tags to be replicated as Strings to the peer cluster. Useful in cases where the peer cluster and the source cluster does not have a common global LABELs table. In order to enable this feature configure the below property in hbase-site.xml <property> <name> hbase.coprocessor.regionserver.classes </name> <value> org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.VisibilityController$VisibilityReplication </value> <property></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12573">HBASE-12573</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Backport HBASE-10591 Sanity check table configuration in createTable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This change backports table schema sanity checks from branch-1. The checks disallow only illegal or highly unusual settings, and can be disabled by setting &quot;hbase.table.sanity.checks&quot; to &quot;false&quot; in site configuration.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12411">HBASE-12411</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Optionally enable p-reads and private readers for compactions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This introduces two new configuration options:</p>
<h1 id="hbase.storescanner.use.pread-enables-postional-reads-for-all-scanners-except-compactions.-default-off-i.e.-try-to-use-seekread-as-before">hbase.storescanner.use.pread enables postional reads for all scanners (except compactions). Default off (i.e. try to use seek+read as before)</h1>
<h1 id="hbase.regionserver.compaction.private.readers-has-compaction-run-with-their-own-readers.-default-off-i.e.-share-readers-with-all-other-scanners-as-before">hbase.regionserver.compaction.private.readers has compaction run with their own readers. Default off (i.e. share readers with all other scanners as before)</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12373">HBASE-12373</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Provide a command to list visibility labels</strong></li>
